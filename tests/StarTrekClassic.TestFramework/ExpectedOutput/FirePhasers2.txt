                                               COURSE
  ONE 'WARP FACTOR' IS THE SIZE OF
  ONE QUADRANT.  THEREFORE TO GET FROM
  QUADRANT 5,6 TO 5,5 YOU WOULD USE COURSE 3, WARP
  FACTOR 1. COORDINATES ARE SPECIFIED USING X,Y NOTATION
  WITH X 1-8 FROM LEFT-RIGHT AND Y 1-8 FROM TOP-BOTTOM.

COMMAND 1 = SHORT RANGE SENSOR SCAN
  PRINTS THE QUADRANT YOU ARE CURRENTLY IN, INCLUDING
  STARS, KLINGONS, STARBASES, AND THE ENTERPRISE; ALONG
  WITH OTHER PERTINATE INFORMATION.

COMMAND 2 = LONG RANGE SENSOR SCAN
  SHOWS CONDITIONS IN SPACE FOR ONE QUADRANT ON EACH SIDE
  OF THE ENTERPRISE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCAN.  THE SCAN
  IS CODED IN THE FORM XXX, WHERE THE UNITS DIGIT IS THE
  NUMBER OF STARS, THE TENS DIGIT IS THE NUMBER OF STAR-
  BASES, THE HUNDREDS DIGIT IS THE NUMBER OF KLINGONS.

COMMAND 3 = PHASER CONTROL
  ALLOWS YOU TO DESTROY THE KLINGONS BY HITTING HIM WITH
  SUITABLY LARGE NUMBERS OF ENERGY UNITS TO DEPLETE HIS 
  SHIELD POWER.  KEEP IN MIND THAT WHEN YOU SHOOT AT
  HIM, HE GONNA DO IT TO YOU TOO.

COMMAND 4 = PHOTON TORPEDO CONTROL
  COURSE IS THE SAME AS USED IN WARP ENGINE CONTROL
  IF YOU HIT THE KLINGON, HE IS DESTROYED AND CANNOT FIRE
  BACK AT YOU.  IF YOU MISS, HE WILL SHOOT HIS PHASERS AT
  YOU.
   NOTE: THE LIBRARY COMPUTER (COMMAND 7) HAS AN OPTION
   TO COMPUTE TORPEDO TRAJECTORY FOR YOU (OPTION 2).

COMMAND 5 = SHIELD CONTROL
  DEFINES NUMBER OF ENERGY UNITS TO ASSIGN TO SHIELDS
  ENERGY IS TAKEN FROM TOTAL SHIP'S ENERGY.

COMMAND 6 = DAMAGE CONTROL REPORT
  GIVES STATE OF REPAIRS OF ALL DEVICES.  A STATE OF REPAIR
  LESS THAN ZERO SHOWS THAT THAT DEVICE IS TEMPORARALY
  DAMAGED.

COMMAND 7 = LIBRARY COMPUTER
  THE LIBRARY COMPUTER CONTAINS THREE OPTIONS:
    OPTION 0 = CUMULATIVE GALACTIC RECORD
     SHOWS COMPUTER MEMORY OF THE RESULTS OF ALL PREVIOUS
     LONG RANGE SENSOR SCANS
    OPTION 1 = STATUS REPORT
     SHOWS NUMBER OF KLINGONS, STARDATES AND STARBASES
     LEFT.
    OPTION 2 = PHOTON TORPEDO DATA
     GIVES TRAJECTORY AND DISTANCE BETWEEN THE ENTERPRISE
     AND ALL KLINGONS IN YOUR QUADRANT
